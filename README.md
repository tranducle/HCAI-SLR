# HCAI-SLR Framework Demonstration

## Introduction

Welcome to the demonstration repository for the Human-Centered AI for Systematic Literature Review (HCAI-SLR) framework. Our framework integrates human expertise and AI capabilities to conduct thorough and efficient systematic literature reviews in academic research.

## Overview

In this demonstration, we apply the HCAI-SLR framework to the topic of "_Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning in Cybersecurity in SMEs: A Systematic Literature Review_." The process illustrates the use of AI tools, including large language models like ChatGPT, and smart interface-based applications, to enhance each step of the literature review.

### Human-AI Interactions

1. **Human Initialization**: Defining the research topic and initiate each step.
2. **AI Augmentation**: Utilizing tools like ChatGPT for generating research questions, keyword identification, draft writing, data extraction, and synthesis.
3. **AI Triangulation**: Cross-validating findings using different AI tools.
4. **Human Oversight**: Final validation and decision-making by researchers.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- **Table of AI-powered Tools**: A table of AI-powered tools with their involvement in each step of SLR.
- **Detailed Demonstration of A Real Case Study**: Examples from AI tools used in the process SLR using HCAI-SLR framework.
- **Excel file of Extracted Data**: An Excel file containing the extracted data from step Data Extraction.

## About the HCAI-SLR Framework

The HCAI-SLR framework is a balanced approach to systematic literature reviews, combining human insight with AI's computational power. It enables researchers to leverage AI for efficiency while ensuring human-led quality and rigor in their reviews.
